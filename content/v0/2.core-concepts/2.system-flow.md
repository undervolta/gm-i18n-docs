# System Flow

Before you're using the GM-I18n API, you need to know how things work in the GM-I18n system. You can skip this section if you already know how things works in GM-I18n system.

## Locale Files Loading

The locale file (if you're using it) will be automatically loaded when you're using the `i18n_create()` function. The loading process is done **asynchronously**, so the `messages` in the file **won't be loaded immediately**. Therefore, you need to wait until the loading is finished before you can use the GM-I18n API. 

Here's how the locale files loading works:

1. You initialize the GM-I18n system using `i18n_create()` function and update the system using `i18n_update_loader()` function.
2. The system check if you're trying to import any locale file using `i18n_create()` function.
3. Your game run by 1 step:
    - If the `time` option was set in the GM-I18n system initialization, add current step to the system. 
        - If the step passed the `time` interval, the system load your unloaded locale file sequentially.
        - If all locale files haven't loaded completely, repeat step 3 until all locale files are loaded to the system.
        - If all locale files have been loaded completely, continue to the step 4.
    - If the `time` option wasn't set in the GM-I18n system initialization, those files will be loaded immediately. Continue to the step 4.
4. The system remove the `loader` after all locale files have been loaded.

**Wrong way (not recommended):**

::code-group
```js [Create Event]
// initialize the GM-I18n system
global.i18n = i18n_create("global.i18n", "en", [
    new I18nLocaleInit("en", "English", "~/langs/en.json"),
    new I18nLocaleInit("id", "Indonesian", "~/langs/id.json")
]);

// get the message from "en" locale
msg = i18n_get_messages("en", "hello");

// print the message
show_debug_message(msg);    

// this will print an empty string (""), because the locale files aren't loaded immediately after the system is initialized. it will load the locale files after 1 step of the game.
// almost all of i18n_* functions that you use before the locale files are loaded won't work properly, whether it's on the objI18n object or other object.
```

```js [Step Event]
// update the GM-I18n system, need certain time to load the locale files
// the `time` is not set in the i18n_create() function, so it will load the locale files immediately after 1 step of this object
i18n_update_loader();
```

```js [Draw Event]
// draw a dynamic message. it will draw an empty text until the locale files are loaded (that contain the "hello" key message)
i18n_draw_message(100, 50, "@:hello", , "header");
```

**Right way (recommended):**

::code-group
```js [Create Event]
// initialize the GM-I18n system
global.i18n = i18n_create("global.i18n", "en", [
    new I18nLocaleInit("en", "English", "~/langs/en.json"),
    new I18nLocaleInit("id", "Indonesian", "~/langs/id.json")
]);

// hardcode the mandatory messages
i18n_add_messages("en", "hello", "Hello World!");

// get the message from "en" locale
msg = i18n_get_messages("en", "hello");

// print the message
show_debug_message(msg);   
```

```js [Step Event]
// update the GM-I18n system, need certain time to load the locale files
// the `time` is not set in the i18n_create() function, so it will load the locale files immediately after 1 step of this object
i18n_update_loader(); 
```

```js [Draw Event]
// draw a dynamic message. it only will draw the message after the locale files are loaded
// the i18n_is_ready() function is optional 
if (i18n_is_ready()) {
    i18n_draw_message(100, 50, "@:hello", , "header");
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
There are two ways to add a `message` to the system: importing the locale file through `i18n_create()` function, or add it manually using `i18n_add_messages()` function after the system is initialized. <br> <br> 

If you aren't setting the `time` option when initializing the GM-I18n system, the system will load all locale files after 1 step of the game. <br> <br>

You're recommended to hardcode the mandatory messages (such as the UI text) so you can use it immediately after the system is initialized. <br> <br>

Use `i18n_is_ready()` to check whether the GM-I18n is ready (all locale files have been loaded) or not.

## Drawing Presets

In a nutshell, the drawing presets are just a **wrapper** for the `draw_set_*` functions. It's optional to use the drawing presets, but it's recommended to use it if you want to draw the translated text consistently.

::code-group
```js [Create Event]
/*
 * i18n_create() code
*/

i18n_add_drawings(["en", "id"], ["header", "body"], [
    new I18nDrawings(fnNotoSans, fa_left, fa_middle, #FFFFFF, 1, 0, 1),             // header
    new I18nDrawings(fnNotoSans, fa_left, fa_top, #CCCCCC, 0.8, 0, 1, -1, 700)      // body
]);
```

```js [Draw Event]
// use the dynamic drawing preset
i18n_use_drawing("header");

/* 
 * the i18n_use_drawing("header") is the same as:
 * draw_set_font(fnNotoSans);
 * draw_set_halign(fa_left);
 * draw_set_valign(fa_middle);
 * draw_set_color(#FFFFFF);
 * draw_set_alpha(1);
*/

// and then draw the message
i18n_draw_message(100, 50, "@:hello");

// you can also use a shorthand (using the drawing preset directly to the i18n_draw_message())
// i18n_draw_message(100, 50, "@:hello", , "header");
```

::alert{type="warning"}
You may call unecessary `draw_set_*` if you don't use the drawing presets, or using the drawing presets in inefficient way. For example, you use `draw_set_font()` before calling `i18n_use_drawing()`, or you use `draw_set_halign()` after calling `i18n_use_drawing()`. <br> <br>

The GM-I18n system is **not** fault-tolerant for this case. It's recommended to use the **drawing templates** to avoid any unexpected behavior. You can see the detailed explanation in the [Optimizations](/v0/advanced/optimizations#drawing-templates) section.
