# Introduction

![GM-I18n Banner](/img/banner-sm.webp)

**GM-I18n** is a simple and powerful internationalization library for GameMaker 2.3+. It primarily focuses on providing a simple and easy-to-use API for easy localization of your game and its content. Don't forget to leave a star on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/undervolta/GM-I18n)! :star:

I'm trying my best to maintain and improve this library as professional as possible, though it's not intended to be a full-fledged localization solution (like [Vue I18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) or [React i18next](https://react.i18next.com/), which is designed for web applications). 

This library is designed to be as fault-tolerant as possible, but it's still a best practice to **back up** your game files before using the GM-I18n system. It's also a good idea to use a **version control system** (like Git or GitHub) to manage your game files.
