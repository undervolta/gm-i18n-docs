# Introduction

![GM-I18n Banner](/img/banner-sm.webp)

GM-I18n is a simple and powerful internationalization library for GameMaker 2.3+. It primarily focuses on providing a simple and easy-to-use API for easy localization of your game and its content, not really intended to be a full-fledged localization solution (like the popular internationalization library for web development). GM-I18n is still in very early stages of development, so there are still many features that are not available yet. Though you can still use the library to translate your game content, there are some limitations that you should be aware of.

Though this library is designed to be fault-tolerant, it's still a best practice to back up your game files before using the GM-I18n system. It's also a good idea to use a version control system like Git or GitHub to manage your game files.
