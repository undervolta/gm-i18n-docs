# Setup

## Requirements

This library has been tested on:

| Platform    | IDE            | Runtime        | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------|
| Windows VM  | v2024.13.1.193 | v2024.13.1.242 | All functions work properly |
| Windows YYC | v2024.13.1.193 | v2024.13.1.242 | All functions work properly |
| HTML5       | v2024.13.1.193 | v2024.13.1.242 | Core functions work properly, but there's an issue with the drawing functions | 

It should work on other versions of GameMaker 2.3+ too. Please let me know on the [tested versions page](https://github.com/undervolta/GM-I18n/issues) if you tested it on other versions and it works.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/undervolta/GM-I18n/releases). <br> <img src="/img/setup-1.webp" alt="Download" loading="lazy" class="max-w-100 h-auto" />
2. Import the `GM-I18n v<version>.yymps` file to your project by dragging it to the IDE. <br> <img src="/img/setup-2.webp" alt="Import" loading="lazy" class="max-w-100 h-auto" />
3. Select the `scI18n` script from the list to import and click `Add`, or just click `Add All`. And finally, click the `Import` button. <br> <img src="/img/setup-3.webp" alt="Ready" loading="lazy" class="max-w-100 h-auto" />

::alert{type="info"}
The `Types` file is also included in the package, but it's not necessary to import it. It's just for better code understanding and readability. You can use it by copy-pasting the code from the file to your own scripts (with fully commented out from the line 1), or open it with different code editor. Use it as a guide or reference to the GM-I18n API. <br> <img src="/img/setup-4.webp" alt="Types" loading="lazy" class="max-w-100 h-auto" />

## Configuration

You can create your own `fonts` asset normally if the language you're using is a Latin-based language. But, if you're adding language with non-Latin characters, you **need** to follow the steps below:

### Using Font Assets

1. Create a new `font` asset in the IDE as you usually do.
2. Click `Add` to add new range to the font asset for each character range you need. Set the `from` and `to` to the first and last character of the range. For example, if you're adding Japanese, you may add _Higarana_ (`12352` to `12447`), _Katakana_ (`12448` to `12543`), and _Kanji_ (`13312` to `19903`). <br> <img src="/img/config-1.webp" alt="Font Asset" loading="lazy" class="max-w-100 h-auto" />
3. Click `Add Range` after you done adding all the ranges you need. 
4. Repeat the steps above for each font you need.

::alert{type="info"}
You can find the character ranges for other languages [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters). Please note that the ranges are in decimal format, while the website shows it in hexadecimal. You can use an online converter to convert the hexadecimal to decimal.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
Please also note that **using too many ranges may cause the font asset to be too large, may cause performance issues, and may the characters won't be displayed correctly**. So, try to use as few ranges as possible. 
::

### Using Included Files

1. Prepare your font files. You can use any font you want, but make sure it's in `.ttf` or `.otf` format. You can convert any font to `.ttf` or `.otf` format using online converters.
2. Click `Menu` button in the Asset Browser (that one with 3 stripes icon), and then click `Included Files`. The `Included Files` window will open, and then click `Open in Explorer`. <br> <img src="/img/config-2.webp" alt="Included Files" loading="lazy" class="max-w-100 h-auto" />
3. A window will open and show you the `datafiles` folder of your project. Copy your font files there (with its license file). You can also make a folder for your font files, for example `fonts`. <br> <img src="/img/config-3.webp" alt="Copy Font Files" loading="lazy" class="max-w-100 h-auto" />
4. In the `Included Files` window, click `Refresh` button. Your font files should now appear in the list. 
5. Create the font asset from code. Use the <a href="https://manual.gamemaker.io/lts/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Fonts/font_add.htm" target="_blank">`font_add`</a> function to create the font asset. For example: 

```js [objController - Create Event]
// font_add(name, size, bold, italic, first, last);
global.font_ja = font_add(working_directory + "fonts/NotoSansJP-Medium.ttf", 32, false, false, 32, 127);
```

::alert{type="warning"}
If you're targetting to HTML5 export, don't use `working_directory` before the file path.
::

6. Repeat step 5 for each font you need. 

::alert{type="info"}
It's recommended to set it to a global variable (and delete it with <a href="https://manual.gamemaker.io/lts/en/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Asset_Management/Fonts/font_delete.htm" target="_blank">`font_delete`</a> if you don't need it anymore). Pass the `32` to the `first` parameter, and `128` to the `last` parameter if you're not sure.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
Please take note that **using this method will load all glyphs in the font**, so **there is risk of a memory leak which will slow down and eventually crash your game**.
