# Global Variables

**GM-I18n** system uses several global variables to manage localization and internationalization. These variables are essential for accessing localized messages, assets, and other related functionalities.

::alert{type="warning"}
**Don't modify these variables directly**. They are intended for internal use by the i18n system and may lead to unexpected behavior if modified.

## i18n_name

The `i18n_name` variable is a global string that holds the name of the initialized i18n system in global scope. 

> `global.i18n_name: String`

```js
global.i18n_name = "";    // once you initialize the i18n system using `i18n_create()`, this variable will be set to the name you provided.
```

---

## \[i18n_name]

The `[i18n_name]` variable is a global reference to the i18n system initialized with the name specified in `i18n_create()`. It allows you to access the i18n system using the name directly.

> `global.[i18n_name]: Struct.I18n`

```js
global.i18n = i18n_create("g.i18n", "en", [                         // the first parameter is the name of the i18n system
    new I18nLocaleInit("en", "English", "~/langs/en.json"),         // its must be same as the global variable you declared to hold the i18n system
    new I18nLocaleInit("id", "Bhs Indonesia", "~/langs/id.json")    // you can use "g." shorthand to refer to the global variable
]);

global.i18n_name = "i18n";              // his will be set automatically to the name of the i18n system

// example if you want to use other name
global.localization = i18n_create("global.localization", "en", [
    new I18nLocaleInit("en", "English", "~/langs/en.json"),
    new I18nLocaleInit("id", "Bhs Indonesia", "~/langs/id.json")
]);

global.i18n_name = "localization";      // this will be set automatically to the name of the i18n system
```
