# Drawing

Drawing is an important part of any game. In GM-I18n, you can draw the translated text using the `i18n_draw_message()` function. It's a wrapper for the `draw_text_*` functions with comfortable additional features, so you can use it just like the `draw_text_*` functions.

## Direct Drawing

Currently, the `i18n_draw_message()` function is the only way to directly draw the translated text in GM-I18n. 

What's make it different from the `draw_text_*` functions?

1. Built-in support for the message key. You can pass the `message key` directly to the function, and it will automatically lookup the message from the locale data, making it a dynamic message without creating any message reference.
2. Built-in support for the drawing presets. You can easily change the `font`, `color`, `alignment`, etc. by just passing the preset name to the function. See the [Drawing Presets](#drawing-presets) section for more information.
3. Built-in support for the message interpolation and pluralization. Just pass the `data` to the function, and the function will handle the rest. See the [Interpolation](/v0/usage/interpolation) section for more information.

You can use the `i18n_draw_message()` function to draw any text, not just the translated text. It's just that you won't get the benefit of the dynamic message, interpolation, and pluralization features.
