# Limitations

As I mentioned before, GM-I18n is still in very early stages of development, so you should be aware of the following limitations before using it in your game.

## Limited Support for HTML5 Export

GM-I18n is not fully compatible with HTML5 export yet. There are some issues with the font loading and drawing functions. I'm already working on it, but I still don't know how to solve it. If you have any idea or suggestion, please feel free to open an issue or start a discussion on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/undervolta/GM-I18n/issues).

### Issue with Font Loading

The font asset created either from the IDE or from code will not be loaded correctly in HTML5 export. It seems like the fonts is loaded asynchronously, so the font asset is not ready when the GM-I18n system tries to use it. This issue can be solved by setting the font manually after the font asset is loaded. Example:

```js[objController - Alarm 0 Event]
var to_refresh = i18n_get_locales_code();   // get all locale codes
var font_locale = "font_";				    // global.font_* that we declared before

for (var i = 0; i < array_length(to_refresh); i++) {
	var presets = struct_get_names(global.i18n.data[$ to_refresh[i]].drawings);     // get all drawing presets
	
	for (var j = 0; j < array_length(presets); j++) {
        // set the font manually. 
        // if it's a latin-based language (eg. "en"), use the default font asset. 
        // if it's not, use the font asset that we created before in the global.font_*
		global.i18n.data[$ to_refresh[i]].drawings[$ presets[j]].font = (to_refresh[i] == "en") ? fNotoSansMedium : variable_global_get(font_locale + to_refresh[i]);
	}
}
```

::alert{type="info"}
You can find the alarm event in the `oI18n` object in the example project.
